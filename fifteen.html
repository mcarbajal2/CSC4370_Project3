	<p>American puzzle author and mathematician Sam Loyd is often falsely credited with creating the puzzle; indeed,<br />
	Loyd claimed from 1891 until his death in 1911 that he invented it. The puzzle was actually created around 1874<br />
	by Noyes Palmer Chapman, a postmaster in Canastota, New York.</p>
